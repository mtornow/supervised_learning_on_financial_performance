# Supervised Learning on Financial Performance

## Aim
The aim of the project is to find patterns with various financial datasets to try to predict the trend which a companies stock will follow.

## Prerequisites/How to use

The data transformation scripts are intended to be used with files in the same format as the two files from /testdata.
First you run pycharm_TransformData to transform the data into a useable format with all the important ratios for later needs.
Afterwards you can load your transformed data (stored in /output) into the the scripts which then derives all necessary models for you.
The extended datasets were combined manually and can be found in the output folder.
The scripts for the analysis of the eight datasets are then namned Script_supervised learning of financial data - initial data only 1-monthly.ipynb or Script_supervised learning of financial data 1-monthly.ipynb (which the second one being the one with the extended data set) and the outputs are saved into the output folder.

The financial ratios are explained in the compFD file.

The report is saved as an pdf in the same folder.
